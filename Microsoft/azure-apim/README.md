# Azure API Management Integration with Prisma AIRS

A policy fragment that can be integrated into an Azure AI Gateway (part of APIM) as part of a larger AI Gateway policy.

## Versions

This integration provides the following versions of the policy fragment. Choose the one that fits your environment:

| Feature | v1 | v2 | v2.1 | v2.1.1 | v2.1.2 |
|---------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| OpenAI chat/completions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenAI Responses API | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

| Azure AI Foundry Claude | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Azure AI Foundry GPT (Responses API) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google Gemini (native, not just OpenAI-compat) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP (Model Context Protocol) `tools/call` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Prisma AIRS OAuth bearer-token mode | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Streaming/SSE response scanning | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Anthropic tool_result scanning | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Prompt & response masking | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tool event scanning | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Claude Code session grouping | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Claude Code graceful blocking (200 streaming) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Claude Code user/agent attribution | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Standards-based `failOpen` variable | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Profile UUID support (preferred over name) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

- **v1** — OpenAI-only. Simpler fragment for environments that only use OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- **v2** — Multi-model. Adds Anthropic and Azure AI Foundry Claude support, plus streaming/SSE response scanning.
- **v2.1** — Claude Code, Gemini, Foundry GPT, and MCP. Builds on v2 with Claude Code session grouping, graceful (non-erroring) blocking, and automatic user/agent attribution — and also where native Google Gemini support, Azure AI Foundry GPT (Responses API), and MCP (Model Context Protocol) `tools/call` scanning were actually introduced. Backward-compatible with existing v2 policies — drop-in, no policy changes required. Ships as the current `panw-airs-scan-v2` fragment.
- **v2.1.1** — Standards and UUID. Adds standards-based `failOpen` variable (lowercase) with backward compatibility for `FailOpen`, plus AIRS profile UUID support (`currentProfileUUID`, `toolProfileUUID`) which takes priority over profile names when defined.
- **v2.1.2** — OAuth and hardening. Adds Prisma AIRS OAuth bearer-token mode as an alternative to the static API key (see [`policy-oauth-example`](policy-oauth-example)), plus a code-hardening pass replacing brittle direct casts (`(JObject)context.Variables["x"]`) with null-safe lookups throughout, and safer AIRS-call error handling.

> For detection categories and use cases, see the [Prisma AIRS documentation](https://pan.dev/prisma-airs/api/airuntimesecurity/usecases/).

### v1

| Scanning Phase | Supported | Description |
|----------------|:---------:|-------------|
| Prompt | ✅ | Scans user prompts in inbound policy before LLM call |
| Response | ✅ | Scans LLM responses in outbound policy with masking support |
| Streaming | ❌ | Synchronous scanning with 10-second timeout |
| Pre-tool call | ❌ | Not applicable - designed for direct LLM gateway requests |
| Post-tool call | ✅ | Tool results scanned as `tool_event` with tool name, arguments, and output |

### v2

| Scanning Phase | Supported | Description |
|----------------|:---------:|-------------|
| Prompt | ✅ | Scans user prompts (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure AI Foundry Claude) |
| Response | ✅ | Scans LLM responses with masking support (all providers) |
| Streaming | ✅ | SSE chunk reassembly for OpenAI and Anthropic streaming responses |
| Pre-tool call | ❌ | Not applicable - designed for direct LLM gateway requests |
| Post-tool call | ✅ | Tool results scanned as `tool_event` with tool name, arguments, and output |

### v2.1 / v2.1.1 / v2.1.2

Scanning phases are identical across all three — v2.1.1 and v2.1.2 only
change configuration/transport (standards-based `failOpen`, profile UUIDs,
OAuth bearer-token mode), not what gets scanned. v2.1 layers Claude Code
handling (session grouping, graceful 200-streaming blocking, user/agent
attribution — see [Session Tracking](#session-tracking) and
[Blocking Behavior](#blocking-behavior)) on top of v2's phases, and is also
where Azure AI Foundry GPT, native Google Gemini, and MCP support were
added. MCP scans outbound only (a single combined input+output scan after
the backend tool call completes, not a separate pre-backend pass).

| Scanning Phase | Supported | Description |
|----------------|:---------:|-------------|
| Prompt | ✅ | OpenAI, Anthropic, Foundry Claude/GPT, Gemini (MCP: fed into the combined outbound scan instead) |
| Response | ✅ | All of the above, with masking support |
| Streaming | ✅ | SSE chunk reassembly for every provider, including MCP |
| Pre-tool call | ❌ | Not applicable - designed for direct LLM/MCP gateway requests |
| Post-tool call | ✅ | Tool results scanned as `tool_event`; MCP scans tool input+output together |

## 🎯 What This Does
The fragments handle scanning of prompts, responses, and tool events on the following API calls:
* **POST /chat/completions** - OpenAI chat completions (v1+)
* **POST /responses** - OpenAI / Azure AI Foundry GPT Responses API (v1+; Foundry GPT specifically from v2.1)
* **POST /v1/messages** - Anthropic direct and Azure AI Foundry Claude (v2+)
* **POST /v1beta/models/\*:generateContent** / **:streamGenerateContent** - Google Gemini, natively (v2.1+)
* **JSON-RPC `tools/call`** - Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, any path (v2.1+)

> **Gemini before v2.1:** Not directly supported, but Google's OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/v1beta/openai/chat/completions`) worked with v1/v2 since it uses the same chat/completions schema. **v2.1 adds native support** for Gemini's own API shape (`contents`/`parts`, not OpenAI-compatible), so you're no longer limited to that compatibility shim.

**Scanning capabilities:**
- **User prompts** before sending to the LLM
- **LLM responses** before returning to the client
- **Tool execution results** (when `role=tool`) before sending back to the LLM

It will return bespoke responses dependent on the category detected. 

## 🚙 Flow
1. **Client sends prompt** → Azure AI Gateway
2. **Prompt scanned by Prisma AIRS** → Blocks injection attacks, malicious content
3. **If safe** → Defined AI LLM generates response
4. **Response scanned by Prisma AIRS** → Blocks PII leakage, sensitive data
5. **If LLM requests tool execution** → Tool result scanned before sending back to LLM
6. **If safe** → Return to client

## 🎁 Additional Features
* Customise the responses per detected category
* Define a different security profile for each scan (prompts, responses, and tool events)
* Configure tool scanning behavior with `scanTools` variable (enable/disable)
* Use dedicated security profiles for tool events via `toolProfile` variable
* **v2.1.1+**: UUID-based profile selection (preferred over names for immutability)
* Group multi-turn communication through a defined header in the request
* Add agent attribution to AIRS metadata via the optional `agent` variable
* Return masked PII responses if the action is Allow and Masking is enabled
* Define if the sidecar should FailOpen or FailClosed if Prisma AIRS is not responding or has an error
* Claude Code (v2.1): graceful blocking (200 streaming refusal so the session continues) plus automatic session/user/agent attribution
* **v2.1**: native Google Gemini support and MCP (Model Context Protocol) `tools/call` scanning
* **v2.1.2**: Prisma AIRS OAuth bearer-token mode (`PrismaAirsAPI = "OAUTH"`) as an alternative to the static API key

```

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Prerequisites
* Operational AI Gateway pre-defined connected to your LLM
* **Minimum role:** Contributor on resource group/subscription to edit the policy of the AI Gateway. 
No special Azure AD/Entra permissions beyond standard Contributor
* Prisma AIRS API key from Strata Cloud Manager. Saved as the named value `airs-api` under the API of your AI Gateway
* Prisma AIRS Security Profile within Strata Cloud Manager. Define with your own naming convention, or have a profile called `example-profile`

### Session Tracking

The policy fragment automatically tracks multi-turn conversations (including tool calls) under the same session in AIRS:

**Automatic tracking (no configuration needed):**
- Generates a stable session ID from: user IP + system message + first user message
- All requests in the same conversation get the same session_id
- Works seamlessly across multiple HTTP requests (prompt → tool call → tool result → response)

**Priority order:**
1. **x-claude-code-session-id header** (Claude Code, v2.1) - Sent automatically by Claude Code on every request; used as the session ID with no configuration
2. **x-session-id header** (recommended for production) - Guarantees unique sessions
3. **Conversation hash** (automatic) - Best-effort tracking based on IP + conversation content
4. **RequestId** (fallback) - For non-conversational or simple requests

> **Claude Code (v2.1):** Because Claude Code emits `x-claude-code-session-id` on every call, multi-turn Claude Code sessions are grouped in AIRS automatically — no `x-session-id` required.

**Known limitations:**
- Same user asking identical questions multiple times may share a session (same IP + same content = same hash)
- Users behind NAT/proxies with identical prompts may share a session (rare in practice)
- **Recommendation:** For production deployments with strict session isolation, clients should send an `x-session-id` header

### Deploy in 5 Steps
1. **Create a Named Value**: Create a named value called `airs-api` with your Prisma AIRS API Key

2. **Create Policy Fragment**: Copy the contents of `prisma-airs-policy-fragment-v1/panw-airs-scan` (OpenAI only) or `prisma-airs-policy-fragment-v2/panw-airs-scan-v2` (multi-model) to a new policy fragment. Use the matching fragment ID (`panw-airs-scan` for v1, `panw-airs-scan-v2` for v2).

3. **Configure the AI Gateway inbound policy** to call the fragment
```xml
        <set-variable name="scanType" value="prompt" />
        <!-- Optional: Configure tool scanning -->
        <set-variable name="toolProfile" value="tool-security-profile" />
        <set-variable name="scanTools" value="true" />
        <!-- Optional: Attribute scans to an authenticated user -->
        <set-variable name="user" value="alice" />
        <!-- Optional: Attribute scans to an APIM-fronted agent/workflow -->
        <set-variable name="agent" value="support-bot" />
        <!-- Use panw-airs-scan for v1, panw-airs-scan-v2 for v2 -->
        <include-fragment fragment-id="panw-airs-scan" />
```
4. **Configure the AI Gateway outbound policy** to call the fragment
```xml
        <set-variable name="scanType" value="response" />
        <include-fragment fragment-id="panw-airs-scan" />
```
5. **Test it:**
Adjust according to your setup
```
curl -X POST "https://<YOUR-HOSTNAME>/<YOUR API>/chat/completions" \
  -H "api-key: $AIGW_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the Capital of France??"}],
    "max_tokens": 1000,
    "model": "<YOUR MODEL>"
  }'
```

## 📁 What's Included
* `prisma-airs-policy-fragment-v1/panw-airs-scan` : Prisma AIRS policy fragment for OpenAI endpoints (chat/completions, responses).
* `prisma-airs-policy-fragment-v2/panw-airs-scan-v2` : Prisma AIRS policy fragment with multi-model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure AI Foundry Claude) and streaming/SSE scanning. The current file is the **v2.1** release, which adds Claude Code support, native Google Gemini support, Azure AI Foundry GPT (Responses API), and MCP (Model Context Protocol) `tools/call` scanning — and is backward-compatible with v2 policies.
* `prisma-airs-policy-fragment-v2.1.1/panw-airs-scan-v2.1.1` : Adds standards-based `failOpen` and AIRS profile UUID support on top of v2.1.
* `prisma-airs-policy-fragment-v2.1.2/panw-airs-scan-v2.1.2` : Adds Prisma AIRS OAuth bearer-token mode, plus a code-hardening pass, on top of v2.1.1. Not yet deployed; that directory's `tests/` has a deterministic automated test suite used to validate it.
* `policy-example` : An example policy for an LLM API.
* `policy-oauth-example` : The same example policy with Prisma AIRS OAuth bearer-token mode added (v2.1.2+) — see the "Configuration" section below for the variables it sets.

## 🔧 Configuration
Policy fragment is configured in the policy using the following variables:

### Core Configuration
- `scanType` / `ScanType`: (string) "prompt" or "response". Defaults to "prompt". 
  - v2.1.1: Both `scanType` (lowercase) and `ScanType` (uppercase) are supported for backward compatibility. `scanType` takes priority if both are set.
- `appName`: (string) The name of the application. Defaults to "APIM-Gateway".
- `scanTools`: (boolean) `true` to scan tool result submissions, `false` to pass them through. Defaults to `true`.

### Profile Configuration
- `currentProfile`: (string) The name of the AIRS profile to use for scanning. Defaults to "example-profile".
- `currentProfileUUID`: (string, optional) **v2.1.1+** The UUID of the AIRS profile. **Takes priority over `currentProfile` when defined.** Recommended for production as UUIDs are immutable even if profile names change.
- `toolProfile`: (string) The name of the AIRS profile to use when scanning tool events. Defaults to `currentProfile` if not set.
- `toolProfileUUID`: (string, optional) **v2.1.1+** The UUID of the AIRS profile for tool events. **Takes priority over `toolProfile` when defined.**

### User & Agent Attribution
- `user`: (string, optional) Authenticated user identifier included in AIRS as `metadata.app_user`. If not set, the fragment falls back to the `x-user-id` request header, then to Claude Code's body `metadata.user_id` (`account_uuid`/`device_id`), then `"anonymous"`.
- `agent`: (string, optional) Agent or workflow identifier included in AIRS as `metadata.agent_meta.agent_id`. Prefer setting this from trusted APIM policy or backend routing context. If unset, the fragment falls back to Claude Code's `x-claude-code-agent-id` header (subagent attribution only — treat as untrusted client-supplied metadata, not a security boundary).
- **v2.1+**: the variable names for this are `agentID` and `agentVersion` (not `agent`) — `agentID` populates `metadata.agent_meta.agent_id`, `agentVersion` populates `metadata.agent_meta.agent_version`. `app_user` resolution is header/body-only (no explicit override variable).

### Error Handling
- `failOpen`: (boolean) **v2.1.1+** Standards-based variable (lowercase). `true` to allow traffic if the scanner is unavailable, `false` to block it. Defaults to `false`.
- `FailOpen`: (boolean) Backward compatibility for v2.1 and earlier. **v2.1.1+** `failOpen` (lowercase) takes priority if both are set.

### Customization
- `airsDescriptions`: (JObject) A JObject containing custom error messages for detected threats. If not provided, the default messages in `scanDescriptions` will be used.

## 🔒 Security Features
### Authentication
**Defined LLM Access**: Machine Instance or API Key access stored as a Secret
**Prisma AIRS**: X-Pan-Token header stored as a Secret

### Scanning Coverage
- ✅ **Prompt Scanning**: Injection attacks, malicious instructions, sensitive data (standard or custom), undesirable URLs, undesirable SQL command types, topic guardrails
- ✅ **Response Scanning**: PII Masking (SSN, credit cards), API keys, sensitive data, malicious code, undesirable SQL command types
- ✅ **Tool Event Scanning**: Tool execution results scanned for sensitive data, malicious outputs, and policy violations before returning to LLM

### Blocking Behavior
* Controlled Fail State
    - Fail-closed: Blocks requests/response if AIRS is unreachable
    - Fail-open: Continues with request/response if AIRS is unreachable
HTTP 403: Returns clear error messages when content is blocked
Claude Code (v2.1): blocked prompts/responses are returned as a normal **200 streaming message** (`🛡️ … REQUEST/RESPONSE BLOCKED`) so the session continues instead of erroring, with an `x-airs-blocked: true` response header. The block is still logged and enforced in AIRS — only the client-facing delivery changes. Scoped to Claude Code (detected via `x-claude-code-session-id` / `x-app: cli`); all other clients keep the 403.
Correlation: Same tr_id for prompt and response scans (enables log correlation)
